                <p>Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. 
                There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of 
                balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line 
                of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. 
                People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. 
                There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.</p>

                <p>This is a sidebar. Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. 
                Both are bodies of water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much 
                smaller bodies of fresh water. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what 
                surround continents.</p>
